# Solo's Prework Webpage

## Description

I created this webpage to help me log all of my notes while working through the boot camp Prework. The notes consist of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

## Usage

To use my webpage, you can review some notes that were taken over HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. If you need suggestions on what to review first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). There you should see a list of topics I learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
